= TODO

* [ ] review project planning or get a kanban board or something and put down these tasks
** [ ] level loader
** [ ] solve the mess with texture loading (data declaration, initialisation, and use are scattered haphazardly from one another without a clear way of reference) (should be partially solved by doing a level loader and level data files)
