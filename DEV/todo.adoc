== prepare
* [x] overhaul makefile
** [x] use the `c++17` standard
* [x] rename cpp headers to use .hpp suffix

== basic rendering
* [x] the basic input-update-display loop
* [x] framerate capping
** [x] implement time duration registering at nanosecond resolution
** [x] implement pauses at nanosecond resolution.
* [ ] conjure a way to keep and pass tile textures efficiently.
* [ ] render a tiled floor test-level

== basic rendering 2
* [ ] implement efficient text printing via the texture-atlas method, monospaced font would be quite enough for now, but design keeping in mind a future update to both mono and variable spaced fonts.
