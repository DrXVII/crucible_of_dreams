= TODO

== prepare
* [ ] overhaul makefile
* [ ] use the `c++17` standard
* [ ] rename cpp headers to use .hpp suffix

== basic rendering
* [ ] run the display loop, framerate capping not necessary at this early stage
* [ ] conjure a way to efficiently keep and pass tile textures
* [ ] render a tiled floor test-level

== basic rendering 2
* [ ] implement efficient text printing via the texture-atlas method, monospaced font would be quite enough for now, but design keeping in mind a future update to both mono and variable spaced fonts.
* [ ] implement pauses using nanosleep or similar instead of the SDL_Delay because the latter is of rather low resolution.
* [ ] framerate handling/capping
