== basic rendering
* [x] the basic input-update-display loop
* [x] framerate capping
** [x] implement time duration registering at nanosecond resolution
** [x] implement pauses at nanosecond resolution.
* [x] read and store pixel data from png
* [x] conjure a way to keep and pass tile textures efficiently.
* [x] implement efficient text printing via the texture-atlas method, monospaced font would be quite enough for now, but design keeping in mind a future update to both mono and variable spaced fonts.

== basic rendering 2
* [ ] come up with architecture to keep and call textures
* [ ] implement first version of level files.
* [ ] create a test level e.g. Ign Alazur - The Ancient Library. Should at least have floor and wall tiles, a few columns/pillars would be good as well.
* [ ] render the test-level

== mop up
* [ ] review and refactor changes
* [ ] plan further

== prepare
* [x] overhaul makefile
** [x] use the `c++17` standard
* [x] rename cpp headers to use .hpp suffix
